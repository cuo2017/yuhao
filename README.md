This is my personal website's code repo.
// ====== Brief Introduction ===== //
I want to use this website to show my own experience and my works. I always try my best to do my works and put a lot of thoughts on each of them.
Just a outline. I will use React as my core framework in building the front-end. Although the data amount is so small, I will insist using Redux.
I will use Antd as my basic UI framework, since it's easy to use in a react project.
As for back-end, I would choose express this time to save time, while chossing MongoDB as the major database.
I will use Fetch as the Interaction of both front-end and back-end.
